## About the Video Course
Are you really keen to learn some cool machine learning algorithms that are making headlines these days? Machine learning applications are highly automated and self-modifying, and they continue to improve over time with minimal human intervention as they learn with more data. To address the complex nature of various real-world data problems, specialized machine learning algorithms have been developed that solve these problems perfectly. 
This course offers an easy gateway to learn about 7 key algorithms in the realm of Data Science and Machine Learning. You will learn how to pre-cluster your data to optimize and classify it for large datasets. You will then find out how to predict data based on existing trends in your datasets. 
This video addresses problems related to accurate and efficient data classification and prediction. Over the course of 7 days, you will be introduced to seven algorithms, along with exercises that will help you learn different aspects of machine learning. This course covers algorithms such as: k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, k-Means, Regression, and Time-Series.
On completion of the course, you will understand which machine learning algorithm to pick for clustering, classification, or regression and which is best suited for your problem. You will be able to easily and confidently build and implement data science algorithms.
